Federal Employee Meeting Cost Tracker

`salary_lookup` is a commandline tool that enables the user to track the cost of a meeting attended by federal employees.

The goal is to make a back-end with Falcon so that a more usable front-end can be deployed.

`falcon_lookup` and `falcon_resource` are the basis of the WSGI app which will call functions from `salary_lookup`.
